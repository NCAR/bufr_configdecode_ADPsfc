The "configs" directory contains a few sample configuration files which can
be provided to the bufrsurface.x executable.  When you want to try one of
these, you must first copy it to a file named bufrsurface_config.

To make your own, copy the bufrsurface_config_Guide_user file to a file
named bufrsurface_config.

When done editing a bufrsurface_config file, you must then copy it to the
...bufr_configdecode/bufrobs directory, i.e., where the data files are located, and where
bufrsurface.x is run.

The parameters to be extracted are identified by mnemonics.  If the set of
default parameters dumped by bufrsurface.x is sufficient, you will not
need to know other mnemonics.  To add more parameters, you will need to refer
to a list, some of which are shown in the ..bufr_configdecode/docs/mnemonics.txt
file.  A complete list is available in the NCEP BUFR document:
http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/data_processing/bufrtab_tableb.htm
It is possible to turn off the default, and obtain only what you want.

Here is a list of the sample configurations, and a description.

CONFIGURATION
FILE                            DESCRIPTION
bufrsurface_config_Guide_user   A template with a description of the options and
                                  how to enter them.

bufrsurface_config_all          Gets everything from the listed file

bufrsurface_config_circles      Gets only the stations within a couple of circles

bufrsurface_config_gmeq         Gets only the stations inside a latitude-
                                  longitude window including the place where the
                                  Greenwich Meridian meets the equator.

bufrsurface_config_high         Gets only the stations within the specified range
                                  of elevation

bufrsurface_config_idl          Gets only the stations inside a latitude-
                                  longitude window for the Bering Strait region,
                                  on either side of the International Date Line.
                                  Note that this includes where the longitude
                                  changes from maximum west (-179.9) to maximum
                                  east (179.9)

bufrsurface_config_US_def       Gets a latitude-longitude window which includes
                                  the 48 contiguous United States

bufrsurface_config_wbb          Gets only the SYNOP stations from the given
                                  WMO blocks

bufrsurface_config_wmo          Gets only the specified SYNOP stations


NOTE: All these configuration files use data file gdas.adpsfc.t00z.20100323.bufr
      as the default input, a couple also use gdas.adpsfc.t06z.20100323.bufr as the default input.  
      These files are already in the ../bufrobs directory, placed there as examples 
      when you untarred this package, and ran the exe/preprocess.csh script.
