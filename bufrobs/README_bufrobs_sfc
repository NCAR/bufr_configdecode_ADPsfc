README_bufrobs:

ds461.0 data files of the form, "gdassfcobs.<YYYYMMDDHH>.tar.gz"
should be copied to this directory.  After all desired data
files have been copied into "bufrobs", the user should edit and run
"exe/preprocess.csh" to prepare the data for use in the decoder
software.

After "exe/preprocess.csh" has been run, users should find a number
of files named "gdas.adpsfc.t<UU>z.<YYYYMMDD>.bufr" and "gdas.sfcshp.t<UU>z.<YYYYMMDD>.bufr"
in this directory.  These are the indivdual BUFR data files.  At this point the user should build a desired 
decoder configuration file (instructions and examples are found in the "configs" directory),
copy the configuration file into this directory, and execute the "../exe/bufrsurfac.x" command
to extract the selected data from the input BUFR files.  Output files will
be written into the "textobs" directory.

**************************************************************************************
To run a software test, simply follow the above steps, leave the pre-staged 
"bufrsurface_config" in place, and decode the data found in the 
"gdassfcobs.20100323.tar.gz" file that has been pre-staged in this directory.
Output files will be written to the "textobs" directory, and can be compared with the
"ADPSFC.20100323<HH>print_US_def_sample" files pre-staged in the "textobs" directory. 
**************************************************************************************

To dump everything found in one BUFR file, the user should execute the "../exe/dumpbufr.x",
and follow the instructions.
