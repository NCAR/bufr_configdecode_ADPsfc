COMPILING AND INSTALLING THE BUFR DECODING SOFTWARE

The relevant bufr_configdecode sub-directories are:

    exe         For keeping the decoder executables.

    install     Has a shell script for compiling and installing the
                  BUFR decoder.

    lib         NCEP BUFR decoder support library - mostly FORTRAN
                  source code, plus a few C source codes.

    src         Two FORTRAN BUFR decoder source code files.  A
                  flexible, user configurable program plus a simple
                  dumping program.


In the install/install.sh script, set the CPLAT variable to reflect the
platform on which you are running.  Initially this is CPLAT=linux.  Now
just run the install.sh script to do the compilations.  This will gather
source code from the bufr_configdecode/src and bufr_configdecode/lib directories and
create executables in the bufr_configdecode/exe directory.  If there are issues
compiling check with your system administrator on compiler dependencies.
